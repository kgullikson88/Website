<h1>Research Interests</h1>
<hr/>

I am involved in several research projects outlined below

<ul>
<li><b>Binary Stars</b><br>
I am working on a survey of A and B field stars, searching for low-mass stellar companions by looking directly for the lines from the secondary star. Our method has the advantage of being more sensitive than both traditional radial velocity monitoring of the primary and adaptive optics imaging for companions a few tens of AU from the primary star. I am working with Adam Kraus and Sarah Dodson-Robinson on this project.</li>

<li><b>Exoplanet Detection</b><br>
I am involved in the McDonald Observatory Radial Velocity Planet Search team, led by Mike Endl and Bill Cochran. I mostly do observing for them, as well as Kepler follow-up observations.</li>

<li><b>Telluric Modeling</b><br>
I have been developing a python code for fitting the telluric absorption spectrum in my data for quite some time. The <a href="http://rtweb.aer.com/lblrtm.html">LBLRTM</a> code has matured to the point where fitting the telluric absorption spectrum can be at least as accurate as the traditional method of observing a telluric standard star, without any of the drawbacks.</li>
