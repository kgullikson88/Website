I am a 4th-year graduate student at the University of Texas, where I work with Adam Kraus on a survey searching for binary companions to intermediate-mass stars. I received by B.S. in physics from the Illinois Institute of Technology in 2010.  <br>


Outside of research, I enjoy several outdoor activities such as hiking, volleyball, and ultimate frisbee.
