# TelFit #
## An Object-Oriented Framework for Fitting the Telluric Absorption Spectrum ##
<hr/>

TelFit is a Python code I wrote specifically to fit the telluric absorption spectrum in astronomical data. I have been using it extensively in my project searching for companions to A and B stars, but it is sufficiently general that it should work on any data. The code is essentially a wrapper to [LBLRTM](http://rtweb.aer.com/lblrtm.html), the Line-By-Line Radiative Transfer Model. It vastly simplifies the process of generating a telluric model, and can efficiently remove the telluric absorption lines in my high-resolution echelle spectra of A and B stars. I have done some tests on late-type stellar spectra as well with good results. I am currently working on a paper officially announcing this code and describing it in some detail; check back here for the link once it is up! You can download the source code below, which includes both LBLRTM and my wrapper. See my [Github page](http://github.com/kgullikson88/Telluric-Fitter) for details and for the "bleeding edge" code.


TelFit is packaged with LBLRTM. If you download TelFit, please also go [here](http://rtweb.aer.com/lblrtm_download.php) to inform the developers of LBLRTM. This helps them keep track of who is using the code and informs future code development.


I will try my best to respond to questions about/problems with the code. However, I am busy and may not be able to help your or may not respond for quite some time. I encourage you to submit issues [here](https://github.com/kgullikson88/Telluric-Fitter/issues) rather than emailing me. 

If you have issues, please check the [FAQ page]({{ content_url('FAQ.html') }})
